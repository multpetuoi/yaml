# How to Use VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28 to Recover Lost Source Code
 
If you are a Visual Basic developer, you may have encountered situations where you lost the source code of your projects due to accidental deletion, hard drive failure, virus attack, or other reasons. In such cases, you may still have the executable files (EXE, DLL, or OCX) of your projects, but without the source code, you cannot modify or debug them.

Fortunately, there is a tool that can help you recover your source code from the executable files: VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28. This is a powerful decompiler and disassembler for programs written in Visual Basic 5.0, 6.0, and .NET technology. It can decompile p-code (the intermediate language used by Visual Basic) into readable VB code, and disassemble native code and .NET assemblies into IL code.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28 to recover your lost source code from your executable files. We will also give you some tips on how to optimize your code for better performance and readability.
 
## What is VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28?
 
VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28 is the latest version of VB Decompiler Pro, a decompiler and disassembler for Visual Basic programs. It has many features that make it a useful tool for recovering source code from executable files:
 
- It can decompile p-code into VB code as much as possible precisely, restoring variable names, constants, arrays, structures, and other elements.
- It can disassemble native code into assembler instructions, and emulate them to generate VB commands.
- It can disassemble .NET assemblies into IL code, and show all tables and modules in managed assemblies.
- It can unpack packed applications (such as UPX, NSPack, etc.) and decrypt encrypted applications.
- It can patch data or obfuscate the project to protect your code from reverse engineering.
- It has a fast decompiling speed and a user-friendly interface.

You can download VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28 from its official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^]. The installation process is simple: just run the setup file and follow the instructions. You will need to enter your name and use a keygen or patch to activate the program.
 
## How to Use VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28 to Recover Source Code?
 
To use VB Decompiler Pro 9.2 Full 28 to recover source code from executable files, follow these steps:

1. Launch VB Decompiler Pro and open the executable file that you want to decompile (you can use the File menu or drag and drop).
2. The program will analyze the file and display its code in a tree-view on the left panel. You can expand the nodes to see the procedures, variables, constants, forms, user controls, etc.
3. Select the procedure that you want to decompile on the left panel. The program will show its p-code (if available), native code (if available), and decompiled code on the right panel.
4. If you want to save the decompiled code, you can use the Save menu or right-click on the procedure name and choose Save As. You can save the procedure list to a MAP file, an IDC script, or a HIEW names file; save all the code in one module to a BAS file; or save the decompiled project only to a VBP file.
5. If you want to modify the decompiled code, you can use the Edit menu or right-click on the code and choose Edit. You can edit p-code directly (if available), patch data (such as strings or numbers), or obfuscate the project (to make it harder to understand).
6. If you want to export the decompiled code to another format, you can use the Export menu or right-click on the procedure name and 0f148eb4a0
